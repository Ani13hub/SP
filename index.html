        <h2>Visa Requirements</h2>

        <h2>Currency of Prague</h2>
        <p>The currency in Prague is the <a href="http://www.myczechrepublic.com/basics/czech_currency.html">Czech Koruna (CZK)</a>. 25 CZK is equalto 1 Euro (Approximately, for your conveinence). Make sure to carry enough CZK in Prague, since most of the shopkeepers, resturants and other sightseeing attractions accept only Koruna. You can even get other currency exchanged in Prague for Koruna.</p>
        <p>There is a <span>genuine exchange center</span> adjacent to the <span>Palladium Mall</span> (Located just about 15-minute walk from the Old Town Square) in Prague which gives the best rate possible.</p>
        <p><span>DO NOT</span> exchange currency at exchange centers which charge an exorbitant commission.</p>
        <p>If you are not carrying enough Koruna, <span>ATM is the best way to withdraw local currency</span>.</p>
